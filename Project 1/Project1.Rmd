##Introduction

This project involves taking a structured chess tournament text file and transforming 
it into a clean CSV dataset containing summarized player statistics.
The workflow programmatically extracts relevant player information and 
computes each player’s average opponent pre-tournament rating. The resulting 
dataset is structured for reproducible analysis and potential database integration.

##Approach

For this project, I will develop an R Markdown workflow to extract and transform
data from a structured chess tournament text file stored in the Project1 directory
of my public GitHub repository. In order to generate the required CSV output, 
I will first read the raw text file into R and examine its structure. 
Because the file is formatted as a fixed-width cross table, I will 
reconstruct each player’s complete record by combining the two lines that represent a single player.

Next, I will extract the required fields for each player: name, state, total 
points, and pre-tournament rating. I will parse opponent numbers from the round
result columns on the first line and include only valid games (wins, losses, and draws) 
in the calculation, excluding byes, unplayed rounds, and forfeit results (X).

To compute the average pre-tournament rating of each player’s opponents, I
will construct a lookup structure that maps player pairing numbers to their
pre-tournament ratings. Using this mapping, I will retrieve the corresponding 
ratings for each opponent and calculate the mean opponent rating based only on 
games actually played. Finally, I will assemble the cleaned and computed data
into a structured data frame and export the results as a CSV file containing the 
required fields (Player Name, State, Total Points, Pre-Rating, and Average
Opponent Pre-Rating), suitable for reproducible analysis and potential database integration.
