## Introduction
This assignment focuses on evaluating the performance of a binary 
classification model. Using predicted probabilities and known class 
labels, the goal is to understand how different decision thresholds 
influence model errors and performance metrics.


Classification metrics

## Approach

To evaluate the performance of a binary classification model, I will work
with a provided dataset containing model-predicted probabilities and true class labels.
My step-by-step plan involves first examining the distribution of the actual class labels to establish
a baseline using the null error rate. I will then assess how converting predicted probabilities into 
class labels at different decision thresholds affects classification outcomes. Using these results, 
I will construct confusion matrices and derive performance metrics to understand how threshold choice 
influences the balance between different types of classification errors.
